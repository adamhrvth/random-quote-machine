# Random quote machine

This is one of my first ReactJS projects. The quote machine has a basic functionality of fetching a random quote by clicking on the "New quote" button. There is also a quote initally by default when running the application.

Quotations are fetched via the Quotable API (https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable).
